                    A blissfully beautiful temple nestled in the city of Visakhapatnam, Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi Temple boasts of a symmetry driven structure with a strong historical background significance.

Dedicated to the Hindu community, the temple offers a divine, relaxing and peaceful atmosphere to the devotees of Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi and is undoubtedly a worth-visiting place for the Hindu community. It is believed that the presiding idol, who is an incarnation of Shri Lakshmi, was the family deity of the rulers of this area at that time and they used to admire her as Ammavari.

Tourists who are planning their Vizag tour just for the weekend or for a long week must take some time off for this religious spot in Visakhapatnam. It is generally said that the presiding deity fulfils everyone’s wishes whosoever comes here to seek the blessings with an open heart.

                There is an interesting tale attached to the origin of Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi Temple. According to locals, the idol of the presiding deity, Ammavari, was found in the well that was located near the fort of the then Rajas. In the year 1912, it was taken out and placed in the centre of the road. To widen the same road, the Municipal Department thought of shifting the statue to some other place and hence, installed it in the corner of the road.

Right after the whole incident i.e., in 1917, the town started suffering from the disease called Plague and so many people died in the village. Seeing the overall condition, people got scared and figured out that it all happened due to the movement of the idol from one place to another. And, to protect the town from this life-taking disease, they bought the statue back to its original place where it was earlier installed.

Owing to re-erection, the village got free of the Plague disease and the villagers had a sign of relief. Since then, the idol of Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi is worshipped by people with full faith and devotion.

On Thursdays, the crowd gets increased to double or triple the number than it is on the other days of the week, as it is considered an auspicious day of the Sri Mahalakshmi. Other festivals on which the Goddess is decked up with all the exclusive ornaments are Ugadi and Navarati occasions.
