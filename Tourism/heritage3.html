                Like Siamese twins, discussions around Bojjana Konda cannot be complete without mentioning its equal counterpart, Lingala Konda. These are two adjacent hill tops atop which stands Buddhist rock-cut caves. While Bojjana Konda is on the Eastern hill, the other is on the West.

Originally, Bojjana Konda was named ‘Buddhina Konda’ but with time, it adapted the name that is more commonly used now because it is believed that people couldn’t pronounce its original name.

Dating back to the 4th and 9th century A. D. respectively, these hills depict the three major Buddhist influences; Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, on the village of Sankaram that was originally called ‘Sangharam,’ which meant monastery. It is believed that the centre of Buddhist culture was in this village.

Alexander Rea, a British archaeologist, in 1906 led the excavation and unearthed an image of Buddha sitting in Buddhanaa or Bojjana and Lingalametta. It is a two-thousand-year-old Buddhist heritage site that contains monolithic stupas, caves, artefacts, etc.Situated in a village called Sankaram, Bojjana Konda represents a significant aspect of Indian history that is surely going to leave you in awe.

                Bojjana Konda is on top of an eastern hill in Sankaram. Monolithic stupas surround rock-cut platforms that contain the maha stupa, the dome of which is completely made of bricks. Archaeological extractions have discovered interesting aspects such as age-old Buddhist coins.

Two of the brick stupas surrounding the maha stupa had miniature stupas or stone relic caskets. An image of Buddhist goddess Hariti has also been found at the foot of the hill on which Bojjana Konda stands.

This hill possesses about six rock-cut caves each intricately sculptured and designed in unique ways. The main cave has about sixteen pillars and a monolithic stupa surrounded by a pradakshina-patha which is a circumambulation of holy shrines made of stone.

Carvings of an umbrella were believed to be on the ceiling of the stupa followed by an entire floor above the cave filled with idols of Buddha.Bojjana Konda is a place that requires you to take a slow stroll around its premises allowing you to peak into a time long forgotten and almost unheard of. The place doesn’t provide you with ample activities to do but it is surely going to leave you with a mind full of knowledge in one visit.

You will be amazed at how spectacular history can seem like two-thousand-years ago. The things you cannot miss out on during your visit to Bojjana Konda are:

The hill on which Bojjana Konda is situated on has about six rock-cut caves that gives you a thrill while walking through them.

        Instances of how Buddhists and devotees who would visit this monastery two-thousand-years ago can still be seen at Bojjana Konda. Prayer halls remain more or less intact which were used by them to offer their prayers. These halls have an elevated platform upon which the leader or ‘Guruji’ would sit while his followers encircled him, below the platform. Lamp holders can still be found in these rooms.

            A vihara translates to a monastery. Bojjana Konda houses a two-thousand-year old vihara where monks and students coming to learn about the religion could reside and study in. Remnants of this are still seen in a few small, plainly cut caves at the hill.
            
            Your visit to Bojjana Konda is welcomed by a life-size figure of Buddha, meditating with a peaceful, calm expression on his face, hands folded together as if welcoming you in the tranquillity of his presence. An instance of the transition of history can be seen from Buddhism to Hinduism with the statue of Lord Ganesha on premises.
